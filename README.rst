Introduction
------------

This is a simple GUI to find a file in a directory tree by name and replace it by
another file. It is mainly meant for ms-windows which lacks the ``find``
program available on POSIX systems.


Requirements
------------

* Python 3
* Tkinter

(Most Python distributions for ms-windows include tkinter.)

Installation
------------

On ms-windows, copy ``far.py`` to the ``Scripts`` directory of your Python
installation. Create a shortcut to it on your desktop.
